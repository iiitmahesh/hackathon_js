                                  A minimal JS based game to test one's observatory skills. As you can see in the below image, one color name is different from its background. <span style="font-style: italic;">(<b>Ex :</b> 3rd bar, it says "Black" while the background is "Violet").</span> When user starts, in the given time span, user should pick the odd one out. Once an option is chosen, the game should continue with new colors and options. Once the time ends, it should show user's accuracy (In percentage).
